# Migrate Unity projects to other engines!

### :warning: This is an early prototype! :warning:

This project is being actively developed and it is not stable yet!
It is currently recommended you either wait, or migrate manually.

### :mag: Your feedback is crucial! 

If you encounter any issues during importing, please [_open an issue_](https://github.com/ProjectUnifree/unifree/issues) on this repository â€” it is vital for the success and improvement of this project.

You can use this tool to help aid migration by providing you with a base, but you _will_ have to modify a lot of code yourself. Please do not under any circumstance expect help regarding this tool from any Godot or Unreal Engine Discord server [_(join our server instead!)_](https://discord.gg/Ee5wJ4JWBQ) And please don't correlate any bad experience you have while using this tool to _"Godot/Unreal sucking and being broken"_, both engines are very stable and game-ready; This is not an official project for either of those engines, this is a community effort.

#### Godot Engine

If you wish to migrate manually to
Godot: [YouTube migration guides](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Migrate+from+Unity+to+Godot), [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)
_(very helpful!)_, [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4JBkykG) _(for any burning questions you can't find answers to
online)_

These other tools would also be very helpful!:

- [UnityGLTF _(Unity 3D models to Godot models)_](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF)
- [Unidot Importer](https://github.com/V-Sekai/unidot_importer)
  and [UnityPackage Godot](https://github.com/barcoderdev/unitypackage_godot) _(Unity assets to Godot assets)_
  (some of these projects may be merged into Unifree, but are not currently)

#### Unreal Engine

If you wish to migrate manually to Unreal
Engine: [helpful UE tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Unreal+Engine+basics+%22(for+Unity+developers)%22), [Unreal Engine docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/unreal-engine-for-unity-developers/)
_(very helpful!)_, [Semi-official Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/unreal-slackers) _(for any burning
questions you can't find answers to online)_

#### Other engines (Cocos, Stride, etc)

Search up a tutorial on YouTube, view the docs, and join your engine's Discord server or subreddit for any questions!
These engines are not currently supported by this tool, as we have a lot more to work on. But support may be added
sometime in the future. We are currently focusing on Godot, as well as Unreal.

## Features

* Scan source project and detect files eligible for migration
* Use ChatGPT to translate `.cs` files into Godot scripts and Unreal 3D classes. Here is how sample translation looks:

```

    }                                                    |
                                                         |
    private void OnEnable()                              |
    {                                                    |
      Vector3 position = transform.position;             |
      position.y = 0f;                                   |

  }                                                      |

## Installation and Usage

`launch.sh` (or `launch.bat` on windows) is the main script that downloads Unifree code, installs a python virtual
environment, installs dependencies and launches the main program (`unifree/free.py`). It accepts following parameters:

| Key                         | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<your_openai_api_key>`     | [How to get an OpenAI API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) |
| `<config_name>`             | Name of the migration. Currently supported: `godot`, `godot-huggingface`, `godot-mono`, `unreal`              |
| `<source_project_dir>`      | Absolute path of the project to migrate                                                                       |
| `<destination_project_dir>` | Absolute path of where results should be written                                                              |

### macOS
